# Linux Process Monitor üñ≤Ô∏è
Process Monitor is a Bash script designed to help you manage, view, and analyze running processes on Unix-like systems. This powerful yet simple tool provides a range of features that make it easier to monitor system performance, terminate unwanted processes, and stay informed about resource usage.
